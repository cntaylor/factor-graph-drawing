# factor-graph-drawing
This is some code to draw nice looking factor graphs, mainly for papers.  I have done this two ways.  
1.  Python/LaTeX.  I originally created some Python code that generated LaTeX/TikZ code.  This repository holds this code
2.  I found I could do both of the above in [typst](https://typst.app/).  For the typst version see [this project](https://typst.app/project/ruT5ks9pNoYEEBqWuDIDUg)

## Why LaTeX/TikZ or Typst
When I am creating factor graphs, I want it to hold nice mathematical symbols inside of the graph.  So for pretty graphs, with math, I found these techniques worked much better than graphviz, or PowerPoint, or...  I wanted a language that understands how to display math to begin with, which both LaTeX and Typst do.
